        Lextract is a Python pipeline that automatically locates, downloads, and
        extracts relevant market definitions from the European Commissionâ€™s
        merger and antitrust decision PDFs. Relevant market definitions
        establish the specific scope of competition legislation and identify the
        specific set of products in an area, making them indispensable for
        economists, lawyers, and regulators when determining the effects of
        mergers and evaluating anticompetitive behavior. However, manually
        retrieving these definitions from the European Commission's verbose
        decision PDFs is extremely time consuming and error-prone. Hence, this
        pipeline has been designed for researchers and competition law experts
        who require a quick and scalable way to extract relevant market
        definitions from many cases at once. Additionally, considering that
        market definitions are highly sensitive and, to some extent, arbitrary,
        Lextract has been designed and implemented to extract definitions as
        accurately as possible, since a slight change in the language of a
        definition can drastically change its meaning. This standard of accuracy
        is accomplished by using strict natural language processing and
        rule-based pattern recognition to identify market definitions while
        excluding all irrelevant information. By automating this process,
        Lextract enables merger and antitrust research at scale and contributes
        to more efficient competition policy analysis.
