        Lextract is a Python pipeline that automatically extracts relevant
        market definitions from the European Commissionâ€™s merger and antitrust
        decision PDFs. Relevant market definitions establish the scope of
        competition legislation and identify the specific set of products in an
        area, which make them indispensable for economists, lawyers, and
        regulators when determining the effects of mergers and evaluating
        anticompetitive behavior. This pipeline has been designed for
        researchers and competition law experts who require a quick and accurate
        way to extract relevant market definitions from many cases at once. This
        level of accuracy is accomplished by using strict natural language
        processing and rule-based pattern recognition to identify market
        definitions while excluding all irrelevant information. By automating
        this process, Lextract enables merger and antitrust research at scale
        and contributes to more efficient competition policy analysis.
